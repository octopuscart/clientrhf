Sir, we are bespoke suit makers, based in Hong Kong with a wide clientele and a long term family tradition in this business for generations.

The fit and quality is something we are very proud of. Besides this, I am sure that the price versus value offered by our company would surprise you. We recognize that a tailor made suit is an investment and we work hard to make sure that your investment is repaid with a well cut suit in a fabulous fabric, finished with immaculate details. We use clothes Ermenegildo Zegna, Marzoni, Luro Piana-Italy, Valentino, Dormeuil, Cashmere Wool 150’s & 120’s.

Mr. Michael is able to offer customers a fitting in our showroom in Kowloon. Fittings generally take about 15 to 20 minutes. Firstly he will measure you for your Jacket, Trouser & Shirt that you may wish to buy. We are most willing to go an extra step to help you.
